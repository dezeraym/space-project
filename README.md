## About NEOWS

The Near Earth Object Web Service (NEOWS) is a RESTful web service provided by NASA to offer information about near-Earth asteroids. It includes data on asteroid close approaches to Earth and allows users to search for specific asteroids or browse the dataset to discover new findings. NEOWS is maintained by NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS).
